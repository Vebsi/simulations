Introduction

TL;DR 
- simulates banking transaction data.

""Folks, I’m telling you, the Northern Lappeenranta Consumption Bank (NLCB)
—and believe me, it's the best—
is now open! 
It’s right by the incredible, tremendous beaches of the lake Saimaa, truly a place like no other. 
Let me tell you, this is huge! We're talking about a bank built from the best Finnish names, the most popular names, you’ve never seen anything like it before. 
People are saying it’s going to be huuuuge!

In this project, we’ve got a bank class, people. 
It’s been designed—absolutely designed—using the finest names in Finland, and every single transaction, folks, is going to be amazing. 
We’re simulating a full year of transactions—no leap years here, just the facts, just the real numbers. 
Only the best years, folks!

Now, every customer has their own special services. Nobody’s seen anything like it.
But guess what? Every once in a while—just once in a while—someone tries to pull a fast one.
Maybe they think they can get away with something. But guess what? We’ve got the best payment system in the world, folks. 
It’s so good, it detects fraud like you wouldn’t believe. It’s a huge system, incredible.
We’ve got custom functions that will catch these criminals and show you their behavior on a graph. 
Believe me, it’s going to be tremendous!""
